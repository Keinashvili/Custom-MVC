# Custom-MVC
This is my version of PHP MVC pattern

NOTE: This is just for educational purposes and hasn't been tested on production!

I am new to php and tried to do mvc pattern on my own, using composer.
I know it has lots of bugs but I am fixing it one by one 

## Project setup
### Go to directory and run composer install
```
composer install
```
### After that go to public directory and run server
```
cd public
```
```
php -S localhost:8080
```
or on any port you want.

### Connect to Database.
You need to open config.php file and configure database properties.
After you connect there will be documentation how to use pattern.
## I hope u will like it!
